As long as there are not conflicts, just about any unicode characters can be used for variables. Interestingly, this means that the characters in Unicode’s [Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_Alphanumeric_Symbols) block are prefectly valid variable names, letting us use the same symbols we would traditionally use to typeset math with. The biggest challenge is making sure that whatever is displaying the code has access to fonts with the needed glyph repertoire. "
